# ADAM - PythonAssistant
An assistant (For Windows) written in Python. ADAM stands for "A Dumb Assistant Mainly". ADAM is less so an assistant and more so a tool for convenience. It can: show the time and date, search the web, open,create and save files in a basic text editor, show the definitions of any word, and pull up a random quote.

## Download exe only - This is the demo as well
An exe can be downloaded by  pressing on "Installer", "SetupADAM.exe" and "Download raw file". OR navigate to releases and download "SetupADAM.exe". When run, windows doesn't like it but you need to press on run anyways. I promise its not malware. Then it's a normal installer.

The reason why I included an installer insteaf of an exe, is because windows does not trust a random exe (with good reason) off of the internet.
